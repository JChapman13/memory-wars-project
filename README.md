## Lessons Learned

As a first project, having only learned Javascript for 2 weeks, what DIDN'T I learn?!

**Planning is incredibly important.** There's really no such thing as too much pseudocode. I had figured that I could give a rough outline what I would need to do, and that I would be fine to just generate on the fly. What that ended me with was quite possibly one of the most complex routes to take to make this game.

**It's fun to make errors!** One of my favourite things to do is problem solve, so when I ran into bugs, it was like a game within a game. Of course, I absolutely had to ask for help, but I learned so much from just being shown some of the things to look for.

**When things feel overwhelming, strip it to its basics**. As the project began to take shape, I found myself sometimes trying to connect the dots with a lot of the functions. I would get overwhelmed and just freeze. What I learned is that starting from the beginning and taking a step by step approach, walking your code through its journey, really helps to visualize.

**Have fun!**

## Roadmap

- Adding a timer to track your progress

- Adding a move counter to track your progress

- Adding the winning timer/move results to the congratulations pop up

- Adding High Scores to view your progress

- Adding some visual effects to make it feel a little more engaging
